# Claude Code Preferences for Artagon Projects

## Git Commit Attribution

**DO NOT** include Claude attribution in git commits.

Specifically:
- ‚ùå Do NOT add "ü§ñ Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)"
- ‚ùå Do NOT add "Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>"

All commits should show only the human author (Trumpickas <trumpyla@gmail.com>).

## Pull Request Attribution

**DO NOT** include Claude attribution in pull request descriptions.

## General Principle

These are professional open source projects. All code contributions should be attributed to human authors only, not AI assistants.
